## Power of two

```
 2^10 == ~1000 == 1kb
 2^20 == ~1mil == 1mb
 2^30 == ~1bil == 1gb
 2^40 == ~1tril == 1tb
 2^50 == ~1quad == 1pb
 ```

## Latency numbers every programmer should know

```
L1 cache reference == 0.5ns
Branch mispredict == 5ns
Mutex lock/unlock == 100ns
Main memory reference == 100ns
Compress 1kb == 10,000ns == 10us
Send 2kb over 1gbps network == 20,000ns == 20us
Read 1mb sequentially from memory == 250us
Round trip within same DC == 500us
Disk seek == 10ms
Read 1mb sequentially from network == 10ms
Read 1mb sequentially from disk == 30ms
Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA == 150ms
```
