Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.

Amazon RDS is a managed database service. It's responsible for most management tasks. By eliminating tedious manual processes, Amazon RDS frees you to focus on your application and your users.

Amazon RDS provides the following principal advantages over database deployments that aren't fully managed:

- You can use database engines that you are already familiar with: IBM Db2, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL.
    
- Amazon RDS manages backups, software patching, automatic failure detection, and recovery.
    
- You can turn on automated backups, or manually create your own backup snapshots. You can use these backups to restore a database. The Amazon RDS restore process works reliably and efficiently.
    
- You can get high availability with a primary DB instance and a synchronous secondary DB instance that you can fail over to when problems occur. You can also use read replicas to increase read scaling.
    
- In addition to the security in your database package, you can control access by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define users and permissions. You can also help protect your databases by putting them in a virtual private cloud (VPC).
