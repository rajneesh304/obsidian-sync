- The filtering operations filters the given stream and returns a new stream, which contains only those elements that are required for the next operation.
- The `Stream` interface has a `filter()` method to filter a stream. This is an intermediate operation. Below is the method definition of `filter()` method.
```
Stream filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
```
- **Parameter ->** A predicate to apply to each element to determine if it should be included.
- **Return Type ->** It returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate.

example:
```
persons.stream()  
        .filter(person -> person.getAge()>27)  
        .forEach(System.out::println);
```

None of the operations modify the original
