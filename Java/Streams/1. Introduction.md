The addition of the `Stream` API was one of the major features added to Java 8. A `Stream` in Java can be defined as a sequence of elements from a source that supports aggregate operations on them. The source here refers to collections or arrays that provide data to a stream.

1. A stream is not a data structure itself. It is a bunch of operations applied to a source. The source can be collections, arrays or I/O channels.
2. Streams don’t change the original data structure.
3. There can be zero or more intermediate operations that transform a stream into another stream.
4. Each intermediate operation is lazily executed (This will be discussed later).
5. Terminal operations produce the result of the stream.

## Stream creation
Streams can be created from different element sources, e.g., a collection or an array with the help of `stream()` and `of()` methods. Below are the different ways to create a stream.

a) Stream.of(v1, v2, v3….)
