- Mapping operations are those operations that transform the elements of a stream and return a new stream with transformed elements.
- We can use a variety of methods to transform a stream into another stream object. The two most common methods used are `map()` and `flatMap()`.

## Understanding map()
The `map()` method takes a lambda expression as its only argument and uses it to change every individual element in the stream. Its return value is a new stream object containing the changed elements.
