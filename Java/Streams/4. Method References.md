- Method references, as the name suggests are the references to a method. They are similar to object references. As we can have reference to an object, we can have reference to a method as well.

- Similar to an object reference, we can now pass behavior as parameters. But, you might be wondering what the difference between a method reference and lambda expressions is. There is no difference. Method references are shortened versions of lambda expressions that call a specific method.

## Four kinds of method references
### 1. Static methods

- The syntax to use static methods as method reference is `ClassName::MethodName`.
```java
.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### 2. Instance method of a particular object
The syntax to use the instance method as a method reference is `ReferenceVariable::MethodName`
We will look at the same example as above, but, this time, the `getLength()` method is not static.
