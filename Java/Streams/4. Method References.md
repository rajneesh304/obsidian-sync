- Method references, as the name suggests are the references to a method. They are similar to object references. As we can have reference to an object, we can have reference to a method as well.

- Similar to an object reference, we can now pass behavior as parameters. But, you might be wondering what the difference between a method reference and lambda expressions is. There is no difference. Method references are shortened versions of lambda expressions that call a specific method.

## Four kinds of method references
### 1. Static methods

- The syntax to use static methods as method reference is `ClassName::MethodName`.
```java
.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### 2. Instance method of a particular object
- The syntax to use the instance method as a method reference is `ReferenceVariable::MethodName`
- We will look at the same example as above, but, this time, the `getLength()` method is not static.
```java
list.stream()
                .mapToInt(demo::getLength)
                .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### 3. Instance method of an arbitrary object
- This type of method reference does not require the object of the referenced class. We can directly use the class name in the method reference.
