- **Multiprocessing -** Multiple Processors/CPUs executing concurrently. The unit of concurrency here is a CPU.
    
- **Multitasking -** Multiple tasks/processes running concurrently on a single CPU. The operating system executes these tasks by switching between them very frequently. The unit of concurrency, in this case, is a Process.
    
- **Multithreading -** Multiple parts of the same program running concurrently. In this case, we go a step further and divide the same program into multiple parts/threads and run those threads concurrently.
