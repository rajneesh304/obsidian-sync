- **Multiprocessing -** Multiple Processors/CPUs executing concurrently. The unit of concurrency here is a CPU.
    
- **Multitasking -** Multiple tasks/processes running concurrently on a single CPU. The operating system executes these tasks by switching between them very frequently. The unit of concurrency, in this case, is a Process.
    
- **Multithreading -** Multiple parts of the same program running concurrently. In this case, we go a step further and divide the same program into multiple parts/threads and run those threads concurrently.

## Processes and Threads

| Process                                                     | Thread                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Process means any program is in execution.                  | Thread means a segment of a process.                                                                               |
| The process takes more time to terminate.                   | The thread takes less time to terminate.                                                                           |
| It takes more time for creation.                            | It takes less time for creation.                                                                                   |
| It also takes more time for context switching.              | It takes less time for context switching.                                                                          |
| The process is less efficient in terms of communication.    | Thread is more efficient in terms of communication.                                                                |
| Multiprogramming holds the concepts of multi-process.       | We donâ€™t need multi programs in action for multiple threads because a single process consists of multiple threads. |
| The process is isolated.                                    | Threads share memory.                                                                                              |
| The process is called the heavyweight process.              | A Thread is lightweight as each thread in a process shares code, data, and resources.                              |
| Process switching uses an interface in an operating system. |                                                                                                                    |
|                                                             |                                                                                                                    |
Since threads share the same address space of the process, creating new threads and communicating between them is more efficient.
