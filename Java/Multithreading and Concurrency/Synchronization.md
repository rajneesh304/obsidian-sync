- [ ] **Intrinsic Locks and Synchronized Blocks:** Learn how to use the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that only one thread accesses a critical section at a time.
- [ ] **Reentrant Locks:** Study the `ReentrantLock` class from `java.util.concurrent.locks` package for more control over locking.
- [ ] **Atomic Operations:** Learn about atomic classes like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`, and `AtomicReference` for lock-free thread-safe operations.
## Intrinsic Lock and Synchronized Blocks
- An intrinsic lock, also known as a monitor lock, is a fundamental concept in Java concurrency that is associated with every object and class. 
- It is used to manage access to synchronized blocks or methods to ensure that only one thread at a time can execute a block of code that is protected by a lock on the same object.
