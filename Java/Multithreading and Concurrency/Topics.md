Futuretopics: 
### 4. **Concurrency Utilities**

- **Executors and Thread Pools:** Understand how to manage a pool of threads using `ExecutorService` and various executor implementations (`FixedThreadPool`, `CachedThreadPool`, `ScheduledThreadPool`).
- **Fork/Join Framework:** Learn about the `ForkJoinPool` for parallel processing, especially when working with recursive tasks.
- **CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier:** Study synchronization aids that allow threads to wait for each other to reach a common point.
- **Semaphore:** Learn how to control the number of threads that can access a resource concurrently.
- **Concurrent Collections:** Understand the use of thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, and `BlockingQueue`.

### 5. **Advanced Topics**

- **Deadlock:** Learn what deadlocks are, how they occur, and strategies to avoid them.
- **Livelock and Starvation:** Study these less common issues and how to prevent them in multithreaded programs.
- **Thread Local Storage:** Understand how to use `ThreadLocal` for maintaining per-thread data.
- **Immutability:** Learn how immutability helps in creating thread-safe classes without synchronization.

### 6. **Memory Management and Visibility**

- **Java Memory Model (JMM):** Understand how the Java Memory Model defines the interaction between threads and memory, including concepts like visibility and ordering of variables.
- **Volatile Keyword:** Learn about the `volatile` keyword to ensure visibility of changes to variables across threads.
- **Happens-Before Relationship:** Study the happens-before guarantee provided by JMM, which helps in understanding thread synchronization.

### 7. **Concurrency Best Practices**

- **Designing Thread-Safe Classes:** Learn the principles of designing thread-safe classes, such as encapsulation, immutability, and proper synchronization.
- **Performance Considerations:** Understand the impact of thread contention, context switching, and how to balance concurrency with performance.

### 8. **Practical Examples and Patterns**

- **Producer-Consumer Problem:** Implement the producer-consumer pattern using various concurrency utilities.
- **Dining Philosophers Problem:** Explore solutions to classical concurrency problems like dining philosophers to deepen your understanding.
- **Thread-safe Singleton:** Learn different approaches to implementing a thread-safe singleton, like double-checked locking and Bill Pugh's method.

### 9. **Testing and Debugging**

- **Tools and Techniques:** Get familiar with tools like `jstack`, `VisualVM`, and `JConsole` for monitoring and debugging multithreaded applications.
- **Testing Concurrency:** Learn how to write unit tests for concurrent code, including stress testing and the use of tools like `ConcurrencyTest` from TestNG.
