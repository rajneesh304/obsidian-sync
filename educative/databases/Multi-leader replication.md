- **Multi-leader replication** is an alternative to single leader replication. There are multiple primary nodes that process the writes and send them to all other primary and secondary nodes to replicate. This type of replication is used in databases along with external tools like the Tungsten Replicator for MySQL.
- This kind of replication is quite useful in applications in which we can continue work even if we’re offline—for example, a calendar application in which we can set our meetings even if we don’t have access to the internet. Once we’re online, it replicates its changes from our local database (our mobile phone or laptop acts as a primary node) to other nodes.
