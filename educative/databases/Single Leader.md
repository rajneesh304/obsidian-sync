**Single Leader or primary-secondary replication**

In **primary-secondary replication,** data is replicated across multiple nodes. One node is designated as the primary. Itâ€™s responsible for processing any writes to data stored on the cluster. It also sends all the writes to the secondary nodes and keeps them in sync.
