- Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java Virtual Machine.
- The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class.
- Singleton pattern is used for [logging](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/logger-in-java-logging-example), drivers objects, caching, and [thread pool](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/threadpoolexecutor-java-thread-pool-example-executorservice).
- Singleton design pattern is also used in other design patterns like [Abstract Factory](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/abstract-factory-design-pattern-in-java), [Builder](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/builder-design-pattern-in-java), [Prototype](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/prototype-design-pattern-in-java), [Facade](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/facade-design-pattern-in-java), etc.
- Singleton design pattern is used in core Java classes also (for example, `java.lang.Runtime`, `java.awt.Desktop`).
